      <h1>Gardening Tips<h1>
        <h2><em>Sun, soil, water and seed or plants are the foundation of your garden</em></h2>

    <h3>Sun</h3>
        <p>The Pacific Northwest has a growing season between 150 and 250 days. Days-to-harvest estimations on seed packets of warm-season crops should be adjusted to accomodate for slowly accumulating heat units (growing days). Look for short-season varieties of seeds. When sowing seed, select an area that recieves at least six to eight hours of sun and turn the soil to 12 inches. </p>

    <h3>Soil types</h3>
      <p>Replenish your soil with compost, manure and plant debris to maintain healthy microbial life and balanced solid composition. Healthy soil equals healthy plants.  </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Clay soils compact easily, drain poorly and can bake your crops in the summer sun. Routinely add compost and other organic materials promote air circulation and improve drainage. </li>
        <li>Sandy or rocky soils are low in organic matter and very pourous. Water drains quickly and with it, any nutrients. Apply a similiar solution to clay soils to improve fertility. </li>
        <li>Loam is perfect soil. It is well drained, easy to dig and rich in nutrients. With proper care and attention, it is possible to create an ideal loam for your crops.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Water</h3>
      <p>Nearly forty percent of household water usage will go toward irrigation. Consider harvesting rain water with a rain barrel, cistern or other water catchement system. It will become a valuable resource on dry days.</p>

    <h3>Seed</h3>
      <p>Good soil, proper sun and watering will make your seeds flourish. A soil thermometer is a helpful tool to determine when to sow. Hasty sowing in chilly and wet soil leaves dormant seeds vulnerable to rotting.</p>
