        <h3>Sun</h3>
            <p>The Pacific Northwest has a growing season between 150 and 250 days. Days-to-harvest estimations on seed packets of warm-season crops should be adjusted to accomodate for slowly accumulating heat units (growing days). Look for short-season varieties of seeds. When sowing seed, select an area that recieves at least six to eight hours of sun and turn the soil to 12 inches. </p>

        <h3>Soil types</h3>
          <p>Replenish your soil with compost, manure and plant debris to maintain healthy microbial life and balanced solid composition. Healthy soil equals healthy plants.  </p>
          <ul>
            <li> Clay soils compact easily, drain poorly and can bake your crops in the summer sun. Routinely add compost and other organic materials promote air circulation and improve drainage. </li>
            <li>Sandy or rocky soils are low in organic matter and very pourous. Water drains quickly and with it, any nutrients. Apply a similiar solution to clay soils to improve fertility. </li>
            <li>Loam is perfect soil. It is well drained, easy to dig and rich in nutrients. With proper care and attention, it is possible to create an ideal loam for your crops.</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Water</h3>
          <p>Nearly forty percent of household water usage will go toward irrigation. Consider harvesting rain water with a rain barrel, cistern or other water catchement system. It will become a valuable resource on dry days.</p>

        <h3>Seed</h3>
          <p>Good soil, proper sun and watering will make your seeds flourish. A soil thermometer is a helpful tool to determine when to sow. Hasty sowing in chilly and wet soil leaves dormant seeds vulnerable to rotting.</p>

        <h3>Composting</h3>
          <p><i>A part of a healthy garden!</i></p>
          <p class="bigger">What you'll need</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Worms!</li>
              <li>A bin for your worms</li>
              <li>A supply of biodegradable bedding (newsprint, computer paper, shredded cardboard, leaves)</li>
              <li>A supply of food waste (vegetable waste, egg shells, spoiled food, NO MEAT OR DAIRY)</li>
            </ul>
          <p class="bigger">Set Up</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Place the bedding in a clean trashcan (5 to 8 pounds of bedding for a 2'x2' box)</li>
              <li>Pour in three pounds of water per pound of dry bedding, and mix well</li>
              <li>Toss in a handful of soil, crushed eggshells, or other additives</li>
              <li>Sprinkle the worms over the surface of the bedding</li>
              <li>Allow a few days for worms to settle</li>
            </ul>
          <p class="bigger">Feeding Your Worms</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Bury scraps under a few inches of bedding in the first section</li>
              <li>Cover the bin with a wooden or plastic top left slightly ajar</li>
              <li>Next time bury the waste under the bedding in the second section</li>
              <li>Worms are low-maintenance, and you can skip two or three weeks without feeding them. Any longer than that, and you'll have a big box of dead worms.</li>
            </ul>
          <p class="bigger">Worm Harvesting</p>
            <ul>
              <li>If you want worms for fishing, harvest the worm castings every two to three months and move the worms to fresh bedding. Follow harvest method #1 ("Dump and hand sort"), and you'll end up with less compost and more worms</li>
              <li>If you practice vermiculture only to produce compost, bury food scraps for four months. Then leave the bin alone for another three or four months. All the worms will be long dead, but they will have left you a box full of nice black vermicompost</li>
              <li>If it's worms and compost you're after, harvest the castings every three to four months and move the worms to fresh bedding. Or help a friend get started composting. As long as you keep feeding them, the worms will keep on casting!</li>
              <li>The Dump and Hand Sort -- Place a large sheet of plastic on the floor or on a table. Put on your rubber gloves. Dump the entire contents of the bin onto the sheet. Shape the compost into cone-shaped mounds. Shine a bright light above the mounds; this will drive the worms toward the bottom interior of each mound. Wait 5-10 minutes, then gently scrape off the layers of vermicompost until all you have left is worms. (You may see tiny, lemon-shaped cocoons; these contain baby worms, so be sure to add them to the new bin.)</li>
              <li>Divide and Harvest -- Shift all the old bedding, castings and worms in the bin to one side. Add fresh bedding to the other side. Bury fresh scraps in the new bedding for a few weeks, and keep the new bedding covered. Leave the old bedding uncovered. Check after a week or two; the worms will have migrated to the fresh bedding. Harvest the vermicompost, then fill the empty side with fresh bedding.</li>
